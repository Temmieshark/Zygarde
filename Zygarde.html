<h1> Zygarde! Look its a rarely ever spoken about legendary from generation 6!! </h1>

<p> Honestly Zygarde is just a good looking pokemon. He does have good stats, all except his special defence and special attack and speed. </p>

<p> Also taking a look at what its weak to.... It's lacking in some good protection from some well used types. </p>

<p> x4 weakness to Ice! Oh wow. Of course Rock, Poison, and Fire only do 1/2 damage to it. Fairy and Dragon doing x2 damage, and everything else doing normal amounts of damage. I guess its fine... If you dont ever go up against ice types with it. </p>
