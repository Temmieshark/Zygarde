<h1> Information </h1>
<p>Zygarde Core was first seen in a trailer for the 2016 Pokemon movie at the end of the movie, Hoopa and the Clash of Ages on July 18th 2015. It was then revealed in the following CoroCoro to be in the anime special Mega Evolution Act 4. It was finally properly revealed in the CoroCoro issue released on September 15th 2015.If it merges with multiple Zygarde Cell, it becomes the brain of further Zygarde Complete Forms. At this stage, this aspect of Zygarde is little more than a part of the Pok√©mon's brain. Unlike the Cells, the Cores are self-aware and can communicate with Cells and other Cores via telepathy. When a change occurs in the local region's ecosystem, Cores have been known to take action.</p>
