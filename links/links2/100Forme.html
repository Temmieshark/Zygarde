<h1> information </h1>
<p> Zygarde Perfect Forme was first seen in a trailer for the 2016 Pokemon movie at the end of the movie, Hoopa and the Clash of Ages on July 18th 2015. It was then revealed in the following CoroCoro to be in the anime special Mega Evolution Act 4. It was finally properly revealed in the CoroCoro issue released on September 15th 2015.
This is the perfect Forme that Zygarde takes when the Core gathers 100% of the Cells. When the ecosystem is under threat, and the Core concludes that the 50% Forme will be unable to deal with it, the Core takes on the Complete Forme. Its power is said to be greater than that of the Legendary Pok√©mon Xerneas and Yveltal! </p>
