<h1> Information </h1>
<p>Zygarde Cell was first seen in a trailer for Mega Evolution Act 4, before being properly revealed in the CoroCoro issue released on September 15th 2015. If it merges with Zygarde Core, it becomes the brain of further Zygarde Complete Forms
This stage has been identified as the single Cells that make up Zygarde. Cells do not possess any will or thought processes. They're found scattered throughout the region. Since they can't use any moves, researchers question whether they can even be called Pokemon!</p>
